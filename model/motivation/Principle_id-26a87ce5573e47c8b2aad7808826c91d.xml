    documentation="The Data Space Governance Framework is a set of guiding principles and practices that ensure the smooth management and oversight of a data space. It defines the roles of the governance authority and participants while setting out the key functions of the data space. To be effective, this framework needs to be flexible enough to respond to internal demands and external changes, like shifts in laws or the arrival of new technologies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Core Concepts: Adaptability, scalability&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Best practices for this approach include building a modular structure that can grow and change as needed, and regularly reviewing the framework to ensure it remains relevant in light of new developments in technology, law, and the market."/>
