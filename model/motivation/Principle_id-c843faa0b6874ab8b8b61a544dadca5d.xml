    documentation="Interconnected Interoperability is the ability of different organizations and participants within a data space to share, understand, and utilize data seamlessly. It is essential for effective data sharing and maximizing the value generated in a data space. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Core concepts: standardized data formats, common data models, standardised API, common communication protocol, Rich metadata&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Best practices. For data interoperability to be successful, a common technical foundation must be established, including using standardized data models, aligning data semantics through common vocabularies, and employing standardized communication protocols. Transfer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or MQTT provide rules for data exchange, while network protocols like TCP/IP ensure reliable data transmission. Provenance and traceability are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability. Regular checks and validations are needed to preserve data quality and avoid errors across systems."/>
